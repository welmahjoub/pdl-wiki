Notes on the Java implementation: Files.readAllLines method returns a List of String  with the content of the text file  Files has also the method readAllBytes  returns an array of Strings. Files.write method writes byte array or into an output file  indicated by a Path object. Files.write method also takes care of buffering and closing the output stream., Notes on the C# implementation: The ReadLines method returns an enumerable object that upon enumeration will read the file one line at a time. The WriteAllLines method takes an enumerable and retrieves a line at a time and writes it until the enumeration ends. The underlying reader will automatically allocate a buffer  thus there is no need to explicitly introduce a buffered stream. WriteAllLines automatically closes the output stream  also in the case of an abnormal termination.
