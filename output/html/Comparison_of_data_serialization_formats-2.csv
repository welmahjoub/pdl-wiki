Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), xsi:nil element (1-4 bits depending on context), 1 bit., 0–12 bits (log2 range) bits for integers with defined ranges less than 4096. Extensible sequence of octets with infinite range for larger or undefined ranges. Also supports custom representations., Scalable floating point representation requiring 18 to 88 bits depending on magnitude. Also supports IEEE and custom representations., Length prefixed sequence of Unicode code points with partitioned string tables for efficient representation of repeated items. The length and code points are represented as variable length unsigned integers where values under 128 require 1 octet each. Also supports custom representations., Repeated elements or length-prefixed list of values. Also supports custom representations., Ordered (sequence) or unordered (all) group of named elements.
