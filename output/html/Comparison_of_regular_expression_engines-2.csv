Nim, nim-lang.org, MIT License, Standard library includes PCRE-based re and nre modules  as well as various alternatives (ex. strutils  pegs (Parsing Expression Grammar matching)  strscans  parseutils  etc.).
Free Pascal (Object Pascal), www.freepascal.org, LGPL with static linking exception, Free Pascal 2.6+ ships with TRegExpr from Sorokin and two other regular expression libraries; See wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Regexpr.
OCaml, Caml, LGPL, As of 2010[update]  the standard module is generally regarded as deprecated;[7] often recommended libraries are pcre (with full support for PCRE) and re (which is not as complete but claims better performance and provides frontends to popular syntaxes: PCRE  Perl  Posix  Emacs  shell globbing).
