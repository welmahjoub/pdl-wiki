Java, C#
Java doesn't have this feature  although a similar effect is possible with the <kbd>Optional</kbd> class var a = Optional.of(42);
var b = Optional.empty();

// orElse(0) returns 0 if the value of b is null
var c = a.get() * b.orElse(0);, int? a = 42;
int? b = null;

// c will receive the null value
// because*is lifted and one of the operands are null
int? c = a * b;
