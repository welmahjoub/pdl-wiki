Type of reactor, RBMK-1000 graphite moderated  2nd generation reactor without containment, BWR-3 and BWR-4 reactors with Mark I containment vessels
Number of reactors, 4 on site; 1 involved in accident, 6 on site; 4 (and spent fuel pools) involved in accident; one of the four reactors was empty of fuel at the time of the accident.
Amount of nuclear fuel in affected reactors, 1 reactor - 210 tons (spent fuel pools not involved in incident)[2], 4 reactors - 854 tons (81 tons in Unit 1 reactor  111 tons in Unit 2 reactor  111 tons in Unit 3 reactor  0 tons in Unit 4 reactor (defueled)  59 tons in Unit 1 spent fuel pool (SFP)  119 tons in Unit 2 SFP  104 tons in Unit 3 SFP  and 269 tons in Unit 4 SFP)[a]
Cause of the accident, Proximate cause was human error and violation of procedures. The unsafe reactor design caused instability at low power due to a positive void coefficient and steam formation. When an improper test was conducted at 1:00 am at low power  the reactor became prompt critical. This was followed by a steam explosion that exposed the fuel  a raging fire  and a core meltdown. The fire lasted for days to weeks  and there is controversy over whether it was the fuel burning  nuclear decay heating or whether the graphite moderator that made up most of the core was involved. See Chernobyl Disaster  Note 1  for more discussion., The plants were not designed with consideration of such a large tsunami. Subsequent review did not lead to mitigation. A major earthquake and tsunami caused the destruction of power lines and backup generators. Once the plants were without external power and the generators were flooded  a catastrophic decay heat casualty ensued  leading to major reactor plant damage including meltdowns and explosive loss of reactor containment.[citation needed]
Maximum level of radiation detected, 300 Sv/h shortly after the explosion in vicinity of the reactor core.[6], 530 Sv/h inside Unit 2 containment vessel in 2017 according to Japan Times.[7]
Radioactivity released, According to IAEA  total release was 14 EBq (14 000 PBq)[8]. 5.2 EBq (5 200 PBq) in iodine-131 equivalent [9][10], As of 2014  a peer reviewed estimate of the total was 340–780 PBq  with 80% falling into the Pacific Ocean.[11] Radiation continues to be released into the Pacific via groundwater.
Area affected, An area up to 500 kilometres (310 mi) away contaminated  according to the United Nations.[12][13][14], Radiation levels exceeding annual limits seen over 60 kilometres (37 mi) to northwest and 40 kilometres (25 mi) to south-southwest  according to officials.[citation needed]
Exclusion Zone Area, 30 km, 20 km (30 km voluntary) extending north-west to 45 km in the downwind direction to Iitate  Fukushima[15]
Population relocated, 335 000 (About 115 000 from areas surrounding the reactor in 1986; about 220 000 people from Belarus  the Russian Federation and Ukraine after 1986), 154 000[16]
Population returned, None, 122 000[17]
Direct fatalities from the accident, Two immediate trauma deaths; 28 deaths from Acute Radiation Syndrome out of 134 showing symptoms; four from an industrial accident (helicopter crash); 15 deaths from radiation-genic thyroid cancers (as of 2005);[18] as many as 4000 to 90000 cancer related deaths.[19], None
Current status, All reactors were shut down by 2000. The damaged reactor was covered by a hastily built steel and concrete structure called the sarcophagus. A New Safe Confinement structure was installed in November 2016  from which the plant will be cleaned up and decommissioned., Cold shutdown declared on 16 December 2011  but decommissioning is likely to take 30 to 40 years.[20][21] All fuel rods in reactor 4 pool removed. Fukushima disaster cleanup is ongoing.
